## Event Listener

The server emits a `ticket-updated` event when a ticket's status is updated. To listen for this event, use the following code:

      const eventEmitter = require('./notification');
      eventEmitter.on('ticket-updated', (ticket) => {
      console.log(Ticket ${ticket._id} updated: ${ticket.status});
      });

Replace `console.log` with your own code to handle the event.
